# Novastro Provenance Gallery

This is a prototype decentralized provenance gallery built on the NEAR protocol using the Novastro real-world asset tokenization framework. 
the idea is to express a fellow community member's understanding of the famous words of CEO of Novastro, Mr.Shreedhar .
"The starting point isn't simply tokenizing assets; it's about reimagining them in fresh onchain formats.

This moves beyond mere replication to truly innovative ways of representing real-world value."

## Features

- Connect with NEAR Wallet
- Add real-world assets with programmable provenance
- Add milestones (repairs, ownership changes, etc.)
- View asset history as a dynamic timeline
- Fully responsive UI for mobile

> Built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, NEAR SDK, and deployed on Vercel.
